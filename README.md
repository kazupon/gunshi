Gunshi is a modern javascript command-line library

> [!TIP]
> gunshi (軍師) is a position in ancient Japanese samurai battle in which a amurai devised strategies and gave orders. That name is inspired by the word "command.”

## ✨ Features

Gunshi is designed to simplify the creation of modern command-line interfaces:

- 📏 **Minimal**: Run the commands with a minimum API.
- 🛡️ **Type Safe**: Arguments parsing and options value resolution type-safely by [args-tokens](https://github.com/kazupon/args-tokens)
- ⚙️ **Declarative configuration**: Configure the command modules declaratively.
- 🧩 **Composable**: Sub-commands that can be composed with modularized commands.
- ⏳ **Lazy & Async**: Command modules lazy loading and asynchronously executing.
- 📜 **Auto usage generation**: Automatic usage message generation with modularized commands.
- 🎨 **Custom usage generation**: Usage message generation customizable.
- 🌍 **Internationalization**: I18n out of the box and locale resource lazy loading.
