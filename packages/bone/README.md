# `@gunshi/bone`

> gunshi minimum

This package exports the bellow APIs and types.

- `cli`: The main CLI function to run the command, **not included `global` and `renderer` built-in plugins**.
- some basic type definitions only.

<!-- eslint-disable markdown/no-missing-label-refs -->

> [!TIP]
> **The APIs and type definitions available in this package are the same as those in the `gunshi/bone` entry in the `gunshi` package.**
> This package is smaller in file size than the `gunshi` package, making it suitable for use when you want to reduce the size of the `node_modules` in your cli application you are creating.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot use the `cli` function in this entry to display the usage of the command with `--help` option.
> This entry point is provided to allow users to customize it completely, such as command usage rendering and plugin composition.
