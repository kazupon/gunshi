> plugin development kit for gunshi

This package provides comprehensive APIs and TypeScript type definitions for creating plugins for gunshi, a modern JavaScript command-line library.

<!-- eslint-disable markdown/no-missing-label-refs -->

> [!TIP]
> **The APIs and type definitions available in this package are the same as those in the `gunshi/plugin` entry in the `gunshi` package.**
> This package is smaller in file size than the `gunshi` package, making it suitable for use when you want to reduce the size of the 'node_modules' in the plugin package you are creating.

About details, See [the plugin development guides](https://gunshi.dev/guide/plugin/introduction) of official docs.
